<h2>In summary!</h2>

<p>I spend much of my time on a motorcycle, in the kitchen or planted firmly in front of a computer. A qualified personal trainer with a strong interest in nutrition, a scholarly approach to self improvement and an eager thirst for technology. I am also interested in giving back to those in need where I can.</p>
