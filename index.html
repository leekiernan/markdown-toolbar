  <p>Not only does the Bear and Ragged Staff serve fantastic food throughout the day, its conversion to a Country Inn is complete with the opening in December 2012 of the last five of nine rooms. The Bear is now in a position to offer a full suite of services to the discerning traveler whether on business or just looking for a home away from home for a few days.</p>
  <p>Our food ethos can be summed up very simply, local where possible, absolutely fresh, prepared in our own kitchen. The Bear's food offering can best be described as eclectic, mainly British food, prepared with loving care and attention in well equipped kitchens, beautifully presented and served by well trained floor staff. And all this with a wine list carefully selected for quality and value.</p>
  <p>Whether you are looking for a simple sandwich or businessman's lunch, a romantic dinner for two or a full on three course meal with wine, port liqueurs and coffee, we have the solution. If you want to hold that special family gathering or a sit down banquet for 80, we can accommodate and tailor our offering to your requirements.</p>
  <p>With addition of our rooms, all featuring internet access, flat screen TVs, en-suite bathrooms, king sized beds and Olde Worlde character, we have now added a new dimension to the Bear experience. In addition we have award winning ales, a play area and garden, a comfy outdoor decking and ample parking.</p>
